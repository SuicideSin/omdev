OMDev (Orion-Mike Developer) is a free opensource 2D (soon to be 3D) graphics platform for use with C++.
It is currently packaged with the Java based text editor JEdit for ease of use.

The goal of OMDev is to package easy to use C++ libraries for 2D Graphics, networking, and serial communication to create games/simulations.
Another huge goal is to make this easy for middle school/high school students to use.

There are some dependencies.

All Systems Dependencies:
	You must have a Java Runtime Environment installed (JRE) to run JEdit.

Linux Dependencies:
	You must have GCC and libx11 installed.  The library libx11 comes natively on most Linux distributions.
	GCC is painless to compile from source, but usually there is a package manager you can use.

	Examples:
		Ubuntu - sudo apt-get install gcc libx11-dev
		Fedora - sudo yum install gcc-c++ libx11-devel

Mac Dependencies:
	Go to http://developer.apple.com/downloads/ and install the "Command Line Tools for Xcode".
	You need to create an account and login before going to the link.

Windows Dependencies:
	None, GCC has been prepackaged for you.

After you have installed the dependencies startup your OS's startup script in the OMDev directory.
	If you're running Linux, start linux.sh.
	If you're running Mac, start mac.sh.
	If you're running Windows, start windows.bat.

IMPORTANT!
To compile and run your code hit F5.
	Pressing F5 will save your code.
	Pressing F5 will compile your code.
	Pressing F5 will tell you any errors in your code.
	Pressing F5 will run the program if not errors are found in your code.
